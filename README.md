This is my 3rd project in FrontEnd Mentor using HTML & Tailwind.

## My process

  1. I setup my environment with vs code
  2. I read the style guide
  3. I applied them in preperation
  4. I created the skeleton of the html
  5. I styled them with tailwind
  6. I organized the code using @layer

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flex Box
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

- The customization of box-shadow in tailwind

### Continued development

There are certain bugs/visuals that I'd like to fix in the future
  - The Image is too wide and tall compared to the given desktop design
  - The Learning border radius is a bit off

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me refer to unfamiliar concepts and resources I may be able to use.
